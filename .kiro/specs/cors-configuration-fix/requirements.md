# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) configuration issue that prevents the frontend application from communicating with the backend API when deployed on Railway. The current CORS setup does not include the Railway production URL in the allowed origins, causing authentication and API requests to fail with CORS policy violations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CORS configuration to allow requests from the Railway production URL, so that the deployed backend can accept requests from the frontend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server starts THEN the CORS configuration SHALL include the Railway production URL `https://neighbourwatch-development.up.railway.app/` in the allowed origins
2. WHEN a request is made from the frontend to the Railway backend THEN the server SHALL respond with appropriate CORS headers
3. WHEN the CORS origins are configured THEN they SHALL include both development and production URLs

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the API configuration to properly handle different environments, so that the frontend connects to the correct backend URL based on the environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs in development THEN the API SHALL connect to the local backend server
2. WHEN the application runs in production THEN the API SHALL connect to the Railway production backend
3. WHEN environment variables are not set THEN the system SHALL fall back to appropriate default values
4. WHEN the API base URL is determined THEN it SHALL be logged for debugging purposes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want authentication requests to work properly across all environments, so that I can log in and access the application features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to log in THEN the authentication request SHALL not be blocked by CORS policy
2. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the user SHALL be able to access protected routes
3. WHEN the user profile is requested THEN the `/api/users/me` endpoint SHALL respond successfully
4. WHEN API requests are made THEN they SHALL include proper credentials and headers

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive CORS headers to be set, so that all types of requests are properly handled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN preflight OPTIONS requests are made THEN the server SHALL respond with appropriate CORS headers
2. WHEN the CORS configuration is applied THEN it SHALL include all necessary HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS)
3. WHEN requests include credentials THEN the CORS configuration SHALL allow credentials
4. WHEN custom headers are used THEN they SHALL be included in the allowed headers list

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CORS configuration to be flexible for different deployment scenarios, so that the application works in various hosting environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CLIENT_URL environment variable is set THEN it SHALL be used as an allowed origin
2. WHEN multiple frontend URLs need to be supported THEN the CORS configuration SHALL accept an array of origins
3. WHEN the server runs in different environments THEN the CORS configuration SHALL adapt accordingly
4. WHEN debugging CORS issues THEN appropriate logging SHALL be available
