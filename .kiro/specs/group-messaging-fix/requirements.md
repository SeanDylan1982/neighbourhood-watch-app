# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical issues preventing group messages from displaying properly in the messaging system. The current implementation is failing with 500 server errors when attempting to fetch group messages, despite successful database queries. This spec focuses on implementing a basic, reliable group messaging system that works immediately, providing a solid foundation for future enhancements.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a group chat participant, I want to see group messages load without server errors, so that I can participate in group conversations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing a group chat THEN the system SHALL successfully fetch messages without 500 server errors
2. WHEN the API endpoint `/api/chat/groups/{groupId}/messages` is called THEN the system SHALL return a valid response with message data
3. WHEN database queries are successful THEN the system SHALL properly format and return the message data to the client
4. WHEN there are no messages in a group THEN the system SHALL return an empty array instead of an error

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a group chat participant, I want to see my group messages displayed in the chat window, so that I can read the conversation history.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN group messages are successfully fetched THEN the system SHALL display them in the chat window
2. WHEN messages are displayed THEN the system SHALL show sender names, message content, and timestamps
3. WHEN the logged-in user sends messages THEN the system SHALL properly identify them as "You" or the user's name
4. WHEN other users send messages THEN the system SHALL display their actual names instead of "Unknown"

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a group chat participant, I want to send new messages to the group, so that I can communicate with other members.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I type a message and click send THEN the system SHALL successfully post the message to the group
2. WHEN a message is sent THEN the system SHALL immediately display it in the chat window
3. WHEN a message is sent THEN the system SHALL notify other group members in real-time
4. WHEN message sending fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and allow retry

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a group chat participant, I want the message loading to be reliable and fast, so that I can have smooth conversations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN opening a group chat THEN the system SHALL load messages within 2 seconds under normal conditions
2. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL implement proper retry logic with exponential backoff
3. WHEN the server is temporarily unavailable THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states and error messages
4. WHEN messages fail to load THEN the system SHALL provide a manual refresh option

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error logging and debugging capabilities, so that I can quickly identify and fix messaging issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN server errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including stack traces and request context
2. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL log the request parameters, response status, and error details
3. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL log the query details and database error messages
4. WHEN debugging is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide detailed console output for troubleshooting
