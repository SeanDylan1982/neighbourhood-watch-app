# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses port configuration inconsistencies in Railway deployment files to ensure reliable server startup with correct port assignments. The system needs to handle port configuration properly across different deployment scenarios while maintaining Railway's dynamic port assignment capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the server to use consistent port configuration across all Railway deployment files, so that the application starts reliably in different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server starts in Railway environment THEN the system SHALL use the PORT environment variable provided by Railway
2. WHEN the PORT environment variable is undefined THEN the system SHALL default to port 5001
3. WHEN multiple Railway deployment files exist THEN all files SHALL use consistent port configuration logic
4. WHEN the server starts locally THEN the system SHALL use port 5001 as the default

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Railway deployment files to handle port assignment correctly, so that the application can be accessed through Railway's assigned URLs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Railway assigns a dynamic port THEN the server SHALL bind to that specific port
2. WHEN the server binds to the correct port THEN Railway's health checks SHALL pass successfully
3. WHEN port configuration is incorrect THEN the system SHALL log clear error messages
4. WHEN the server starts THEN it SHALL log the actual port being used

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent error handling for port configuration issues, so that deployment problems can be quickly identified and resolved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN port binding fails THEN the system SHALL log the specific error and attempted port
2. WHEN the PORT environment variable contains invalid data THEN the system SHALL fall back to the default port
3. WHEN port configuration changes THEN the system SHALL validate the new configuration before binding
4. WHEN deployment fails due to port issues THEN error messages SHALL clearly indicate the port-related cause
