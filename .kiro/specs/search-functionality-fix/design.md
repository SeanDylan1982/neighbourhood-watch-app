# Search Functionality Fix Design

## Overview

This design addresses the current issues with the search functionality by implementing a robust, regex-based search system that doesn't rely on MongoDB text indexes and provides proper navigation to search results.

## Architecture

### Frontend Components
- **SearchBar**: Enhanced autocomplete component with proper navigation
- **SearchResults**: Improved results display component
- **SearchPage**: Dedicated full search results page

### Backend Services
- **SearchService**: Refactored to use regex-based queries instead of text search
- **Search Routes**: API endpoints for autocomplete and full search

## Components and Interfaces

### SearchBar Component
```javascript
interface SearchBarProps {
  onResultSelect?: (item: any, type: string) => void;
  placeholder?: string;
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Debounced autocomplete with 500ms delay
- Keyboard navigation support
- Recent search history display
- Navigation to search results page on Enter

### SearchService Class
```javascript
class SearchService {
  async searchAll(query, options): Promise<SearchResults>
  async searchUsers(query, options): Promise<User[]>
  async searchNotices(query, options): Promise<Notice[]>
  async searchReports(query, options): Promise<Report[]>
  async searchChats(query, options): Promise<Chat[]>
  async searchMessages(query, options): Promise<Message[]>
}
```

**Key Changes:**
- Removed dependency on MongoDB text indexes
- Implemented regex-based search with relevance scoring
- Added proper error handling for database queries

## Data Models

### Search Results Structure
```javascript
interface SearchResults {
  users: User[];
  notices: Notice[];
  reports: Report[];
  chats: Chat[];
  messages: Message[];
}
```

### Relevance Scoring
- Title matches: 3 points
- Content/description matches: 1 point
- Name matches: 3 points
- Email matches: 1 point

## Error Handling

### Database Query Errors
- Graceful fallback to empty results
- Proper error logging and classification
- User-friendly error messages

### Network Errors
- Retry logic for failed requests
- Loading states during search
- Timeout handling for slow queries

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- SearchService methods with various query inputs
- SearchBar component interactions
- Search result navigation logic

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end search flow from input to results
- API endpoint testing with authentication
- Database query performance testing

### Performance Tests
- Search response time under load
- Memory usage during large result sets
- Concurrent search request handling
