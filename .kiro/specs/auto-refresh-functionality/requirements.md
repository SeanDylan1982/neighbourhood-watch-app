# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements automatic refresh functionality for notices and reports to ensure users always see the most current content. Currently, when users perform actions like pinning/unpinning notices, creating new posts, or when other users make changes, the interface doesn't automatically update to reflect these changes. Users must manually refresh the page to see updates, which creates a poor user experience and can lead to confusion about the current state of content.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a community member, I want the notice board to automatically refresh when I pin or unpin a notice, so that I can immediately see the updated pin status without manually refreshing the page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user pins a notice THEN the system SHALL immediately update the notice list to show the pinned status and reorder pinned items to the top
2. WHEN a user unpins a notice THEN the system SHALL immediately update the notice list to show the unpinned status and reorder the list accordingly
3. WHEN the pin/unpin action fails THEN the system SHALL revert the UI to the previous state and show an error message
4. WHEN multiple users are viewing the same notice board THEN pin/unpin actions by one user SHALL be reflected for all users within 5 seconds
5. IF the network is slow or unavailable THEN the system SHALL show loading states during pin/unpin operations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a community member, I want the reports section to automatically refresh when I create a new report or when others create reports, so that I can see the most current list of community reports without manual page refreshes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully creates a new report THEN the system SHALL immediately add the new report to the top of the reports list
2. WHEN another user creates a report THEN the system SHALL update the current user's reports list within 10 seconds
3. WHEN a report creation fails THEN the system SHALL show an error message and not add any placeholder items to the list
4. WHEN reports are updated or deleted by moderators THEN the system SHALL reflect these changes in real-time for all users
5. IF a user is viewing a specific report when it gets updated THEN the system SHALL show a notification about the update

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a community member, I want the notice board to automatically refresh when new notices are posted by other users, so that I can stay informed about the latest community updates without constantly refreshing the page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN another user posts a new notice THEN the system SHALL add the new notice to the current user's notice board within 10 seconds
2. WHEN a new notice is added THEN the system SHALL show a subtle notification or indicator that new content is available
3. WHEN multiple new notices are posted simultaneously THEN the system SHALL batch the updates to avoid overwhelming the user interface
4. WHEN the user is actively interacting with the notice board THEN the system SHALL queue updates and apply them when the user is idle
5. IF the user has scrolled down in the notice list THEN new notices SHALL be added without disrupting the user's current scroll position

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a community member, I want real-time updates for notice and report interactions (likes, comments, status changes), so that I can see the current engagement level and status of posts without manual refreshes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user likes or unlikes a notice/report THEN the system SHALL immediately update the like count for all viewers
2. WHEN a comment is added to a notice/report THEN the system SHALL update the comment count and show the new comment in real-time
3. WHEN a moderator changes the status of a report THEN the system SHALL immediately reflect the status change for all users
4. WHEN engagement metrics change THEN the system SHALL update counters smoothly without jarring UI jumps
5. IF multiple interactions happen rapidly THEN the system SHALL debounce updates to maintain smooth performance

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a community member, I want the system to handle network connectivity issues gracefully during auto-refresh operations, so that I have a reliable experience even with unstable internet connections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the network connection is lost THEN the system SHALL show an offline indicator and queue pending updates
2. WHEN the network connection is restored THEN the system SHALL automatically sync queued updates and refresh content
3. WHEN auto-refresh requests fail THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic
4. WHEN the user manually refreshes during network issues THEN the system SHALL prioritize the manual refresh over automatic updates
5. IF the system detects stale data due to connectivity issues THEN it SHALL show a warning and offer a manual refresh option
