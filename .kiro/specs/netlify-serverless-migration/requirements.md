# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the migration from Railway to Netlify due to the end of the Railway trial period. Since Netlify doesn't support traditional Express.js servers, the backend needs to be converted to serverless functions that can run on Netlify Functions. This migration will maintain all existing functionality while adapting to a serverless architecture.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate the Express.js server to Netlify Functions, so that the backend can run on Netlify's serverless platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server is migrated THEN all API endpoints SHALL be converted to individual Netlify Functions
2. WHEN a function is deployed THEN it SHALL maintain the same API contract as the original Express routes
3. WHEN functions are called THEN they SHALL handle CORS properly for cross-origin requests
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the original functionality SHALL be preserved

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain database connectivity in serverless functions, so that data operations continue to work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a function needs database access THEN it SHALL establish a connection using connection pooling
2. WHEN database operations are performed THEN they SHALL handle connection timeouts gracefully
3. WHEN functions complete THEN database connections SHALL be properly managed to avoid leaks
4. WHEN multiple functions run concurrently THEN they SHALL share database connection pools efficiently

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want authentication to work seamlessly with serverless functions, so that I can continue to log in and access protected features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to log in THEN the authentication function SHALL validate credentials and return JWT tokens
2. WHEN protected endpoints are accessed THEN they SHALL validate JWT tokens correctly
3. WHEN tokens expire THEN the refresh mechanism SHALL work properly
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN appropriate error responses SHALL be returned

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want real-time features to work with serverless architecture, so that chat and notifications continue to function.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN real-time features are needed THEN they SHALL be implemented using WebSocket alternatives compatible with Netlify
2. WHEN messages are sent THEN they SHALL be delivered in real-time or near real-time
3. WHEN users are online THEN their status SHALL be tracked appropriately
4. WHEN notifications are triggered THEN they SHALL be delivered to the correct users

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the client application to seamlessly connect to the new Netlify backend, so that users experience no disruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the client makes API calls THEN they SHALL be routed to the correct Netlify Function endpoints
2. WHEN the environment is development THEN the client SHALL connect to local development functions
3. WHEN the environment is production THEN the client SHALL connect to deployed Netlify Functions
4. WHEN API calls are made THEN they SHALL include proper headers and authentication tokens

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want file uploads to work with serverless functions, so that users can continue to upload images and attachments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN files are uploaded THEN they SHALL be processed by serverless functions
2. WHEN large files are uploaded THEN they SHALL be handled efficiently within function limits
3. WHEN uploads complete THEN files SHALL be stored in appropriate cloud storage
4. WHEN file operations are performed THEN they SHALL respect security and size limitations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling in serverless functions, so that issues are properly logged and handled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur in functions THEN they SHALL be logged with appropriate detail
2. WHEN functions timeout THEN graceful error responses SHALL be returned
3. WHEN database connections fail THEN retry mechanisms SHALL be implemented
4. WHEN critical errors occur THEN they SHALL be reported for monitoring and alerting
