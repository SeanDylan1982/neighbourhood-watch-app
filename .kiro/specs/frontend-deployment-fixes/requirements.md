# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The frontend application is successfully deployed on Vercel and connecting to the Railway backend, but there are several critical issues affecting user experience and functionality. These issues include service worker registration failures, audio loading errors, and manifest parsing problems that need to be resolved to ensure a smooth production experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the service worker to register properly so that I can have offline functionality and improved performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the service worker SHALL register successfully without MIME type errors
2. WHEN the service worker is registered THEN it SHALL provide offline capabilities for cached resources
3. IF the service worker registration fails THEN the application SHALL continue to function normally without offline features
4. WHEN the service worker is active THEN it SHALL cache critical application resources for offline access

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want notification sounds to load properly so that I can receive audio feedback for important events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application initializes THEN all notification sound files SHALL load without encoding errors
2. WHEN a notification event occurs THEN the appropriate sound SHALL play successfully
3. IF a sound file fails to load THEN the application SHALL continue without audio feedback and log the error
4. WHEN sound files are missing or corrupted THEN the application SHALL provide fallback behavior

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the web app manifest to be valid so that I can install the app as a PWA and have proper metadata.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the browser requests the manifest THEN it SHALL return valid JSON without syntax errors
2. WHEN the manifest is parsed THEN it SHALL contain all required PWA metadata fields
3. WHEN the app is installable THEN the manifest SHALL provide proper app icons and display settings
4. IF the manifest has errors THEN the browser SHALL still allow basic functionality

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging so that I can diagnose and fix production issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with sufficient detail for debugging
2. WHEN service registration fails THEN the error SHALL be caught and handled gracefully
3. WHEN audio files fail to load THEN the errors SHALL be logged but not crash the application
4. WHEN manifest parsing fails THEN the error SHALL be handled without affecting core functionality

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work reliably in production so that I have a consistent experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads in production THEN all critical features SHALL work without console errors
2. WHEN network conditions are poor THEN the service worker SHALL provide cached content
3. WHEN audio is not available THEN the application SHALL continue to function normally
4. WHEN PWA features are not supported THEN the application SHALL work as a regular web app
