## 🧪 Testing

### Local Testing Setup
```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Start local development server
netlify dev --port 8888

# Test endpoints
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/auth-register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"testpass123","firstName":"Test","lastName":"User","acceptedTerms":{"termsOfService":true,"privacyPolicy":true}}'
```

### API Endpoint Mapping
| Traditional Server | Netlify Function |
|-------------------|------------------|
| `/api/auth/login` | `auth-login` |
| `/api/auth/register` | `auth-register` |
| `/api/auth/refresh` | `auth-refresh` |

## 🚀 Deployment Ready
- Functions are ready for Netlify deployment
- Frontend will automatically detect Netlify environment
- CORS is properly configured
- Database connections use environment variables

## 📝 Notes
- All functions include comprehensive error handling
- Database schema is replicated in serverless functions
- JWT secrets are configurable via environment variables
- Functions are optimized for cold start performance
