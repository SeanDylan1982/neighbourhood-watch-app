# Favicon Setup

To complete the favicon setup, please manually copy the logo file:

**Source:** `client/src/components/Common/Logo/logo.png`
**Destination:** `client/public/favicon.png`

This will ensure the favicon displays correctly in browser tabs.

Alternatively, you can convert the PNG to ICO format and save as `favicon.ico` for better browser compatibility.
