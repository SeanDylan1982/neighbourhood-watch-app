# Railway Debug Deployment

## Current Status

The health check is still failing even with our minimal servers. We've now created a comprehensive debug server that will help us understand exactly what's happening during Railway's health check process.

## Debug Server Features

The `server/railway-debug.js` includes:

### üîç Comprehensive Logging
- All incoming requests with timestamps
- Request headers and client IP addresses
- Environment variables and system information
- Self-health check after startup

### üéØ Multiple Health Check Endpoints
- `/api/health` - Primary health check
- `/health` - Alternative health check
- `/healthz` - Kubernetes-style health check  
- `/ping` - Simple ping endpoint

### üõ°Ô∏è Enhanced Error Handling
- Detailed error logging with timestamps
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Client error handling
- Uncaught exception handling

### üìä Detailed Health Check Response
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-08T...",
  "uptime": 1.234,
  "port": "5001",
  "railway": true,
  "debug": true,
  "method": "GET",
  "url": "/api/health",
  "headers": { ... },
  "env": {
    "NODE_ENV": "production",
    "PORT": "5001",
    "PWD": "/app/server"
  }
}
```

## Configuration Updates

### railway.json
```json
{
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "node server/railway-debug.js",
    "healthcheckPath": "/api/health",
    "healthcheckTimeout": 300,
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10,
    "numReplicas": 1
  }
}
```

### Key Changes
- **Increased timeout**: 300 seconds (5 minutes) for health checks
- **Debug server**: Maximum logging and error handling
- **Multiple endpoints**: Various health check paths
- **Self-testing**: Server tests itself after startup

## What to Expect

When deployed, the debug server will log:

1. **Startup Information**:
   - Port binding details
   - Environment variables
   - Railway-specific variables
   - Working directory

2. **Health Check Requests**:
   - Exact timestamp of each request
   - Request method and URL
   - Client IP address and headers
   - Response details

3. **Self-Health Check**:
   - Server tests its own health endpoint
   - Logs success/failure of internal connectivity

## Debugging Process

1. **Deploy** with the debug server
2. **Monitor logs** during health check phase
3. **Identify** the exact failure point:
   - Is the server starting?
   - Is it binding to the correct port?
   - Is Railway reaching the health endpoint?
   - What's the exact error or timeout?

## Possible Issues We'll Identify

### Server Not Starting
- Port binding issues
- Missing dependencies
- Environment variable problems

### Health Check Not Reached
- Railway not finding the endpoint
- Network connectivity issues
- Port mapping problems

### Health Check Failing
- Server responding with wrong status code
- Response format issues
- Timeout problems

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy** and monitor the comprehensive logs
2. **Analyze** the exact failure point from debug output
3. **Fix** the specific issue identified
4. **Switch back** to minimal server once working

This debug approach will give us the exact information needed to solve the health check failure once and for all.

## Local Testing Results

‚úÖ Debug server works perfectly locally:
- Responds to all health check endpoints
- Provides comprehensive logging
- Handles all request types correctly
- Self-health check passes

The issue is specifically with Railway's environment or health check process, which we'll now be able to identify precisely.
