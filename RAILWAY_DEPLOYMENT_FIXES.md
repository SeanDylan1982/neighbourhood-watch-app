# Railway Deployment Fixes

## Issues Resolved

### 1. CORS Configuration Conflicts
**Problem**: Multiple conflicting CORS configurations causing preflight request failures
**Solution**: 
- Consolidated to single CORS configuration in server/index.js
- Removed duplicate CORS middleware
- Added proper origin validation for Railway, Vercel, and localhost
- Fixed preflight OPTIONS handling

### 2. Environment Variable Configuration
**Problem**: Invalid PORT configuration using `||` syntax in .env files
**Solution**:
- Fixed PORT=5001 in all environment files
- Corrected NODE_ENV settings for production
- Ensured consistent environment variable format

### 3. Server Startup Issues
**Problem**: Complex initialization causing Railway health check failures
**Solution**:
- Created simplified `railway-start.js` for Railway deployment
- Implements graceful startup with basic health check first
- Initializes full application after server is listening
- Added proper error handling and fallback mechanisms

### 4. Health Check Endpoint
**Problem**: Health check endpoint not responding during startup
**Solution**:
- Added immediate basic health check in railway-start.js
- Simplified health check response for Railway
- Reduced initialization complexity for faster startup

### 5. Static File Serving
**Problem**: Complex static file configuration causing issues
**Solution**:
- Simplified uploads static file serving
- Removed complex CORS headers from static file middleware
- Streamlined file serving configuration

### 6. Client API Configuration
**Problem**: Frontend not connecting to correct backend URL
**Solution**:
- Verified client environment variables point to Railway backend
- Ensured API_BASE_URL resolves correctly
- Added proper fallback mechanisms

## Files Modified

### Server Files
- `server/index.js` - Cleaned up CORS, removed duplicates, fixed initialization
- `server/railway-start.js` - NEW: Simplified Railway startup script
- `server/package.json` - Updated start script to use railway-start.js
- `server/.env*` - Fixed PORT configuration and environment settings

### Configuration Files
- `railway.json` - Updated to use railway-start.js as start command
- `Dockerfile` - Updated CMD to use railway-start.js

### Client Files
- `client/.env*` - Verified API URLs point to Railway backend
- `client/src/config/api.js` - Confirmed API configuration

### Test Files
- `test-railway-deployment.js` - NEW: Test script to verify deployment

## Deployment Process

1. **Build Phase**: Dockerfile builds both client and server
2. **Startup Phase**: railway-start.js provides immediate health check
3. **Initialization Phase**: Full application initializes after server is running
4. **Health Check**: Railway can verify service is running via /api/health

## Key Improvements

1. **Faster Startup**: Basic server starts immediately for Railway health checks
2. **Better Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks if full initialization fails
3. **Cleaner CORS**: Single, comprehensive CORS configuration
4. **Simplified Configuration**: Removed complex and conflicting settings
5. **Better Logging**: Enhanced logging for debugging deployment issues

## Testing

Run the test script to verify deployment:
```bash
node test-railway-deployment.js
```

## Next Steps

1. Deploy to Railway with these fixes
2. Monitor health check endpoint
3. Verify frontend can connect to backend
4. Test API endpoints functionality
5. Monitor logs for any remaining issues

## Health Check URLs

- Railway: https://neighbourwatch-development.up.railway.app/api/health
- Local: http://localhost:5001/api/health

The health check should return:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-08T...",
  "uptime": 123.456,
  "environment": "production",
  "port": 5001,
  "services": "basic",
  "railway": true
}
```
